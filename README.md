# Football-Data-Analysis-using-SQL
This soccer database comes from Kaggle. It contains data for soccer matches, players, and teams from several European countries from 2008 to 2016. This dataset is quite extensive, it contains 25,000 plus matches of 10,000 players in 11 European Countries with their lead championship for Seasons 2008 to 2016. Players and Teams' attributes* are sourced from EA Sports' FIFA video game series, including the weekly updates. Team line up with squad formation (X, Y coordinates) .Betting odds from up to 10 providers. Detailed match events (goal types, possession, corner, cross, fouls, cards etcâ€¦) for +10,000 matches are included.I am using this data set and trying to get some interesting output since football and SQL are the two things which I like the most.
